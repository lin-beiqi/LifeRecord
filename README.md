# LifeRecord
Recording my life here.

I made this for recording my shitty life. As you can see, that's the evalution I made for my past life. SHITTY.
I will take the postgraduate entrance exam at Dec 20th. There is two weeks left.
But I have not been study for a while.
Maybe due to anxiety, I have been thinking a lot for this two days. So many things came into my mind. It almost made me giving up... with so much invisibly spiritual pain.

MY DREAM IS TO REALIZE THE 'THING'.
I AM NOT SURE WHAT THE 'THING' SURE BE CALLED. IT IS SOME KIND OF 'AGI' OR MOST POWERFUL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENT EVER. THE REASON THAT I AM NOT SURE WHAT IT SHOULD BE CALLED, IS BECAUSE THE CORE OF THE 'THING', WHITCH HAS THE ABILITY TO QUANTIFY, SIMULATE, AND EVEN SURPASS HUMAN THINKING. JUST IMAGINE, THE DEVELEPMENT OF HUMAN BEING. IT WAS ACTUALLY SHORT TO THE WHOLE UNIVERSE. NEARLY LIKE A SECOND COMPARE TO ONE MMILLION YEARS. WHAT WE CAN DO NOWADAYS IS TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE 1000 YREARS AGO. DUE TO HUMAN'S INTELLIGENCE, WE CAN DO A LOT COMPARE TO THE ANCIENT PEOPLE. 
BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. WHAT IF WE SIMULATE AND ACCELERATE THE HUMAN THOUGHT OR THE THINGS I DON'T KNOW THAT DETERMINE THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUNMAN BEING, WE CAN JUST BLOW UP! I AM SURE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. (SORRY FOR MY ENGLISH ABILITY.)

That's it. That's the thought support me to... I don't know... should I called it keeping away from the reality? Hahahaha... But every time the thought come to my mind, I just feel pretty ambitious...

Today I saw a sentence goes that "Detect what you love and pursue it lifelong, that makes a rich and fulfilling life." this sentence nearly blew my mind when I read it first time.

I must strive for my dream all my life! No mater what will happen in the future. I would not give up! 

Here is the specific tasks I want to reach:
participate Kaggle competitions.(the main way I learn from scratch.)

I have so much to say, but limited to my English level, I can't express myself well, yet. I am pretty sure that there is so many syntax error in this content, but that's it, that's all I can do so far.
