    "I remembered one year ago. When I want to study new things to start a new phase, the second time of preparing the postgraduate entrance exam is mess with my learning plan. I was so regretful, I hoped if I can regardless of the learing plan that learning the postgraduate entrance exam knowledge, but focus on the only one thing studying the new things. But due to the pass strategy and paid for the past stupid, I had to do it.\n",
